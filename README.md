# GPT-J Chat Interface

Welcome to GPT-J Chat Interface - a simple yet powerful chat platform utilizing the power of GPT-J AI model and the real-time decentralized Gun.js database.

## Description

The GPT-J Chat Interface is a project where a basic chat interface is built using HTML and Javascript. It uses Gun.js for its database, and jQuery and moment.js for convenience and date formatting respectively. The chat messages are processed using a GPT-J AI model (as seen in the provided accompanying Jupyter notebook). Please note that this project doesn't include the backend setup for the GPT-J AI model. You need to set it up separately and modify the code to integrate it with this chat interface.

## Features

- Live chat interface with Name and Message input fields

- Timestamps with messages

- Utilizes Gun.js, a decentralized peer-to-peer database

- Potential integration with GPT-J AI model

## Project Structure

This project consists of a single HTML file with inlined JavaScript.

- HTML structure with necessary div, form, input and script elements

- External scripts included are:

  - jQuery (version 1.11.3)

  - Gun.js

  - Moment.js

## Setup and Usage

1\. Clone the repository

2\. Open the HTML file in your browser

## Integrating GPT-J AI model

The GPT-J AI model can be used to make the chat interface smarter and more interactive. An example of such integration is available in the accompanying Jupyter notebook. The actual implementation, which is beyond the scope of this project, would involve hosting the GPT-J AI model on a server, and sending the chat messages to the model for processing. The responses can then be displayed in the chat interface.
